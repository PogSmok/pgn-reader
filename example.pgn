1. Nf3 {A flexible move, committing no central pawns and a favorite of the great Kramnik.}
1... Nf6 {Equally flexible in response.} 2. c4 {Establishing some central control and preparing Nc3.}
2... g6 {Bobby was a lover of placing bishops on long diagonals, especially in his youth!}
3. Nc3 {Establishing control of the light squares (d5 and e4) in the center.}
3... Bg7 {\"Fianchettoing\" the bishop and getting ready to castle.}
4. d4 {Reverting to a d4-opening.} 4... O-O {Castling!} 5. Bf4 {Avoiding the King's Indian Defense.}
(5. e4 {The King's Indian Defense, an opening destined to be associated with Bobby.}) 
5... d5 {The Gruenfeld Defense - This sharp opening allows White a big center and tries to attack it with active pieces.}
6. Qb3 {Pressuring d5 and b7.} 6... dxc4 {Giving up a stake in the center and seeking to gain time attacking the queen after it recaptures on c4.}
7. Qxc4 {Recapturing.} 7... c6 {Advancing the attacked c-pawn and controlling d5. This is considered a bit passive today.
...Na6, preparing to play ...c5, is preferred.} 8. e4 {Building the perfect pawn center.} 8... Nbd7 {Developing the knight.} 
9. Rd1 {Placing the rook in support of the center. This does not feel like the most useful move though.} 
(9. Be2 {Why not get ready to castle?}) 9... Nb6 {Hitting the queen.}
10. Qc5 {Keeping an overly advanced posture? This move is not a mistake yet, but it is risky and creates the tactical opportunity in two moves.}
(10. Qb3) 10... Bg4 {developing the final minor piece and threatening to double the pawns.} 11. Bg5? { One too many dubious moves.
This accomplishes nothing AND it places the bishop on a vulnerable square after Bobby's next brilliant move!} (11. Be2 {Castle. Simple.}) 11... Na4!!
{Fischer strikes! This move undermines the knight on c3 which holds e4. 
\"A brilliant most surprising stroke ... A murmur went through the tournament room after this move,
and the kibitzers thronged to Fischer's table as a fish to a hole in the ice.\" - Hans
Kmoch in Chess Review from 1956} 12. Qa3 {Retreating the queen while trying to keep an eye on e7.}
(12. Nxa4 {Accepting the sacrificed knight.} 12... Nxe4 {The knight threatens both c5 and g5. Note also that ...Qa5+ can also be possible.}
13. Bxe7 {Threatening the black queen instead of retreating.} (13. Qxe7 Qa5+!
{attacks too many White pieces.}) 13... Re8 14. Bxd8 Nxc5+ 15. Be2 Bxf3 16. gxf3
Nxa4 {Black is about to win a pawn and has a much better structure and better
pieces.}) 12... Nxc3 {Eliminating the defender of the e4-square.} 13. bxc3
{Recapturing.} 13... Nxe4! { Fischer gives up e7, but he rips open the center.}
14. Bxe7 {Faced with total collapse in the center, Byrne tries to win material for his trouble by forking the queen and rook.} 14... Qb6
{Advancing the threatened queen to create more threats.} 15. Bc4 {Finally developing the last piece and hoping to castle.}
(15. Bxf8 {This doesn't work because the bishop on g7 now gets to swing around to attack the queen and create a pin tactic.} 15... Bxf8 16. Qb3 Nxc3! 17. Qxc3 Bb4!9) 15... Nxc3!
{ Clearing the e-file so that ...Re8 might win the bishop on e7.}
16. Bc5 {Pulling the bishop off the dangerous e-file and attacking the queen. Has Fischer missed this?
Will he lose the c3-knight after retreating the queen?} (16. Qxc3 Rae8!9 {The pinned bishop
cannot be saved.}) 16... Rfe8+ {Fischer first activates the rook and threatens the white king.} 
17. Kf1 {The only logical way out of check. Fischer now has a queen and knight hanging. What is to be done?}
17... Be6!! { The second brilliant move! Fischer leaves his queen hanging and threatens the bishop on c4!
All the tactics work perfectly for Fischer.} 18. Bxb6 {Byrne accepts the queen.}
(18. Bxe6 {This move allows the famous \"smothered mate\" pattern.} 18... Qb5+ 19. Kg1 Ne2+ 20. Kf1
Ng3+ 21. Kg1 Qf1+! 22. Rxf1 Ne2#) (18. Qxc3 Qxc5!!9 { A nice pin to pick off the bishop.}) 
18... Bxc4+ {Fischer snags the bishop with check, but more importantly, he sets up a \"windmill,\" a repeating sequence of checks that wins material.}
19. Kg1 {forces} 19... Ne2+ {Dragging the king back into the line of fire.} 20. Kf1 {forces} 20... Nxd4+ {Snagging a pawn.} 21. Kg1 {forces} 21... Ne2+ {Dragging the king back again.} 22. Kf1 {forces}
22... Nc3+ {Attacking the rook on d1.} 23. Kg1 {forces} 23... axb6!

(24. Qc1 {Trying to defend the d1-rook.} 24... Ne2+ {A nasty royal fork.})

25... Nxd1 {Fischer has a rook, two bishops, and a pawn for the queen AND the rook on h1 is completely out of play. 
The game is over at this point, and I'll save the remaining explanations for the video :)}
